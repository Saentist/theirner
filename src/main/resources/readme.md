Bitcoinâ€™s own security is based on 256-bit private keys. 256 bits or, for bitcoin, 51 character-long base-58 keys (which use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters and numbers, barring a few that look too similar), may not seem very long or complicated. However, two-to-the-power-256 is a huge number: 1 followed by 77 zeros or, more accurately, 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936.
